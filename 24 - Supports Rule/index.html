            Don't see a circle? The @supports property knows that, and didn't
            serve up that style for you.

            We CSS3 ninjas like to push the boundaries of web design, which
            means we get to dance on the bleeding edge of supported code.
            Unfortunately, everyday ordinary citizens and their old & outdated
            browser software may not be as "fresh" as us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fear not, there's a CSS3 rule that recognizes the downfalls of the
            everyday ordinary browsing citizen, and rectifies the problem,
            leaving the user blissfully unaware of our epic-ness.
          </p>
          <h4>Enter the @supports rule</h4>
          <p>
            It's simple, really. Just use the @supports rule to to check a CSS
            <code>property: value</code> pair, like so...
          </p>
          <pre>
  <code>
@supports (border-radius: 100px) {
  .fresh {
    border-radius: 100px;
  }
}
  </code>
</pre>
          <p>
            If the browser understands, it will generate the style within the
            curly braces, otherwise, it'll move on... Like a chump.
